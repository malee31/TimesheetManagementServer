# Timesheet Management Server
A proper, fully built API for managing users and work session clock in times.  
Intended to be the successor version of the old API that depends on client-side validation and is unscalable.  

An experiment in excellent API design, test-driven development, and documentation.

## Documentation
API documentation can be found in `API.md` until a proper documentation site is written out.

## Testing
Testing is completed using Jest and most test files are stored besides the source files as `*.test.js` files.  
Run the unit tests by using `npm test`.
